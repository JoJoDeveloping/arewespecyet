## About

Are We Spec Yet tries to answer the question: **Does Rust have a specification (yet)?**

## How to use the site

This website attempts to track the progress of all those working towards giving Rust a (formal) specification.
This includes specifications in prose and using formal language, and includes specification of the type system, trait system, semantics, the grammar, and maybe even other parts like the macro system.

We also try to track which of these are "official" or otherwise blessed by official Rust teams.
Once a usable specification exists, we will start tracking its adoption by the various tools that consume Rust and aim to give formal guarantees, like Rust verifiers.
