<h2>Heroku {{ level(level=3) }}</h2>

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud PaaS tool that supports collections of languages. It does not support Rust natively, however, you can run Heroku with [github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust](https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust), a popular but unofficial buildpack.

<h2>AWS Lambda{{ level(level=0) }}</h2>

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) supports Rust natively with an [opensource runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime)! There is also an unofficial but very popular AWS SDK, [rusoto](/topics/services/#pkg-rusoto_core).

<h2>Docker {{ level(level=0) }}</h2>

There are [official docker images](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/docker-rust) for rust ([`rust`](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust/)) with over 10+ Million downloads! There are also nightly images ([`rustlang/rust`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rustlang/rust/)) if your application requires it. If you use docker's [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), you can build your application binary and then copy it into a container. This allows you to avoid deploying the entire compilation toolchain with your web application.

<h2>Cloud-Native Buildpacks {{ level(level=3) }}</h2>

[Cloud-Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) is a CNCF project that provides a specification for automatically transforming source code into OCI images you can run on any cloud. Paketo Buildpacks, a popular implementation of the Cloud-Native Buildpacks specification, has a [Rust buildpack](https://github.com/paketo-community/rust/) that supports transforming your Rust source code into OCI images.

Present features: pick your Rust version including nightly, automatically detects your binaries and configures the container to run them, supports projects with multiple binaries & workspace projects, supports installing additional tools via `cargo install`, can optionally install `tini` for proper pid1 handling, can generate images as small as a few MB plus your binaries, and loads of caching for fast rebuilds.

<h2>Vercel {{ level(level=3) }}</h2>

[â–² Vercel](https://vercel.com/), (formerly Zeit) is a cloud platform for serverless functions. There is a community rust runtime, [vercel-rust](https://github.com/vercel-community/rust).

<h2>Unikernels {{ level(level=2) }}</h2>

Unikernels are the rising star and newest hot thing to do big scale deployment. With Rust being a system language unikernels are an obvious approach to the problem and doing your research you'll find that there is a lot happening here indeed. There's a number of unikernels which support rust:

- [nanos](https://github.com/nanovms/nanos)
- [rumprun](https://github.com/rumpkernel/rumprun) with `--target x86_64-rumprun-netbsd`
