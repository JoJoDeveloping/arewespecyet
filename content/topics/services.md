intro = "The modern web development stack doesn't only need a web-server but is often built on a range of external services to provide specific features, from worker queues to search and pubsub. There are many mature crates for popular external services. For services accessed through a Web API, such as Cloud SDKs, see: [External Web APIs](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/web-apis/) and for database support, see: [Databases](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/database/)"
