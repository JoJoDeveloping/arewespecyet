Welcome to Are We Spec Yet, where we attempt to track Rust's journey towards a formal specification.
Since developing a specification is hard, and since there is no one central place where the specification is developed, and since people disagree on what even is a specification, we feel that a website like this is in order.

For example, you might have heard of [Ferrocene](https://spec.ferrocene.dev). But what are they trying to do? What are they not trying to do? Is their document a formal specification? Who else is working on specifying Rust, and how does their work relate to this?
We hope to answer all these questions on our website.
